# CI Utilities

This repository contains a collection of scripts and modules designed to help manage and monitor Continuous Integration (CI) processes. These tools can be particularly useful in large projects where CI processes can become complex and difficult to manage.

## Tools

### GitHub CI Monitor with Retry Capabilities

The GitHub CI Monitor is a Python script that monitors the CI status of a specific pull request in a GitHub repository. If the CI process fails, the script has the ability to retry the failed checks. This can be particularly useful in situations where CI checks fail due to temporary issues, such as network errors or server downtime.

For more information about how to use the GitHub CI Monitor, see the [README](retry/README.md).

## Getting Started

To use these tools, you will need to clone this repository and install any necessary dependencies. Each tool may have its own specific requirements, so be sure to check the README for each tool.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have a script or module that you think would be useful, feel free to open a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
